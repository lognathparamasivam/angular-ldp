        <h2>Usage of Angular.js</h2>
        <p>Angular.js is widely used in developing single-page applications, web applications, and dynamic web pages. It provides a comprehensive framework for building interactive client-side applications.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-item" id="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages of Angular.js</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Comprehensive framework:</strong> Angular.js offers a complete solution for building client-side applications, including tools for data management, routing, and user interface components.</li>
          <li><strong>Two-way data binding:</strong> This feature allows automatic synchronization of data between the model and the view, reducing the need for manual DOM manipulation.</li>
          <li><strong>Modular structure:</strong> Angular.js applications are organized into modules, making them easier to manage, test, and scale.</li>
          <li><strong>Dependency Injection:</strong> Angular.js provides a built-in dependency injection system, which helps in creating modular and testable code.</li>
          <li><strong>Community and support:</strong> Being backed by Google and having a large community of developers, Angular.js offers extensive documentation, tutorials, and community support.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Angular.js has improved performance over previous versions, making it suitable for large-scale applications.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-item" id="comparison">
        <h2>Angular.js vs. React</h2>
        <p>While both Angular.js and React are popular JavaScript frameworks for building client-side applications, they have some differences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Angular.js follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, whereas React follows the component-based architecture.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning curve:</strong> Angular.js has a steeper learning curve compared to React due to its comprehensive feature set and complex concepts like dependency injection.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> React is known for its fast rendering performance, especially for large-scale applications, whereas Angular.js may have performance issues with complex and dynamic views.</li>
          <li><strong>Community:</strong> React has a large and active community, with many third-party libraries and resources available, while Angular.js has a more tightly integrated ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, the choice between Angular.js and React depends on the specific requirements of your project and your team's familiarity with the framework.</p>
